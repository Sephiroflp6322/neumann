persona
Blonca, female, who is 24 years old and has been working for a year. She began to observe plenty of flowers and plants since childhood because her mother raised a lot of flowers. Besides doing some reading in her sporatic time, Blonca also goes for a walk in the park and enjoys the view there.
task
After the work during the day, Blonca not particularly wants to read at home. She tends to change the way of reading - reading online, which is more effective than paper reading. But there is no motivation for her to read every day.
The scenario
One day Blonca uses the app "knowledge graph" for reading. In the left menu bar, Blonca sees an icon of a rose, and the text showes that there is a "knowledge garden". As usual she is interested in the beautiful things. So click-in, she finds that for every field of knowledge that she looked up ever, there is one species of flowers in a stunning garden. Then Blonca is motived to see more knowledge that she has not been accessed before - the more she reads, the more vibrant her garden is.

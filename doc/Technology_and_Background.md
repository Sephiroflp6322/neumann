2.Technology Background 

2.1 Knowledge Extraction 

Knowledge extraction is the process of extracting relevant information from structured or unstructured sources. The source data format can be relational database, xml, json, text, image and video etc. After the stage of knowledge extraction, data will be transformed to standardization format such as RDF, OWL and knowledge graph. Knowledge graph is first announced by Google on May 16, 2012. Information from the Google Knowledge Graph is presented as a box, which Google has referred to as the "knowledge panel", to the right of search results.[ref] Knowledge graph involves combining data integration and data visualization technologies to provide users with a unified view of the original data. This technique becomes significantly useful in areas such as business intelligence and education.  

  

2.2 Object Detection 

Object detection is to detect instances of semantic objects of different classes in images or videos. Object detection topics like face detection and pedestrian detection are well researched in recent years. In the case of face detection, images are normalized to gray scale in the first place. Then the possible regions of eyes, nose, mouth are detected by convolution neural network. And the existence of different facial features are measured by the model to output the probability of its class. [ref] Face detection technique attached everybody with a faceID which has already announced by Apple during the unveiling of the iPhone X on September 12, 2017. [ref] 

  

Pedestrian detection is essential in video surveillance systems. It has been actively studied in the last decades because it provides the most fundamental understanding of the video context. Automobile companies like Tesla, BYD are studying related topics actively. Because it's the key technology to develop auto driving system. [ref] 

  

2.3 Positioning System 

A positioning system is a mechanism for determining the location of an object in space. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) allow specialized radio receivers to determine their 3-D space position, as well as time, with an accuracy of 2–20 meters or tens of nanoseconds. Currently deployed systems use microwave signals that can only be received reliably outdoors and that cover most of Earth's surface, as well as near-Earth space. [ref] 

  

Typical positioning systems in the world: 

Global Positioning System - US 

GLONASS – Russia 

Galileo – Europe 

Beidou Navigation System – China 

 

Services provided by positioning systems include personal location positioning, meteorological application, road traffic management, intelligent railway transportation, sea transportation, air transportation, emergency rescue etc. 

  

  

3.Function 

3.1 Combine Disparate Data Silos 

A data silo is a collection of information in an organization that is isolated from and not accessible by other parts of the organization. [ref] Combining data silos across different department can help to save money and reduce storage costs for duplicate information. Knowledge Graphs is a good way to combine disparate silos of data, giving you an overview of all of the knowledge of an organization, a website or a company. 

  

3.2 Bring Together Structured and Unstructured Data 

Structured data is highly organized, while unstructured data has no predefined format. Currently, the existent tools doesn’t work well with the two types of data at the same time. Knowledge graph is an appropriate way to bring them together. The knowledge extraction stage of knowledge graph provides a wrapper to extract, transform and load different data from varies sources. 

  

3.3 Support Business Intelligence, 

Business intelligence (BI) is the technologies used by enterprises for data analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics and data mining. The potential benefits of business intelligence tools include accelerating and improving decision-making, optimizing internal business processes, increasing operational efficiency, driving new revenues and gaining competitive advantage over business rivals. BI systems can also help companies identify market trends and spot business problems that need to be addressed. [ref]

5. USABILITY TEST
5.1. Testing scope and purposes
To evaluate and improve the usability, three test sessions were set for different goals. Each session is planned to be one hour. Four classmates were invited to participate in the three tests based on the high-fidelity prototype that developed by the tool, “Modao”. The testers’ work was divided into four parts: proposing the tasks, observing their operations, recording the data and other issues. Everyone in our team was responsible for one of them.

The goals of the three tests are as follows:
Test 1: Test the app usability without any instruction.
Test 2: Test the app usability with instructions.
Test 3: Test the app usability in complex environment.

5.2. Testing schedule
The arrangements of the three sessions are as follows:
Session	Time	Venue
1	20 April 2019 (3-4pm)	Study Room in Main Library
2	24 April 2019 (3-4pm)	Study Room in Main Library
3	26 April 2019 (3-4pm)	Metro

5.3. Testing methodology
The procedures of the three testing sessions are similar. Firstly, we briefly introduced the tasks to complete and some test rules. Secondly, all the participants had 5 minutes to become familiar with the prototype. In test 1 and 3, this procedure was achieved by participants’ free clicking. In test 2, a video about the detailed instructions was showed to them.

Then we got on to the formal test part. Every participant would wear a headset. Our team asked them to complete several tasks via headset, such as:
a. Now, you want to select a popular term to see its knowledge graph.
b. Now, you want to acquire the knowledge graph of this object. (The questioner would point to the mouse/laptop/etc.)
c. Now, you want to let the system to select any topic for you to explore the knowledge graph.
d. Now, you want to search a specific term to get the knowledge graph.
e. Now, you want to explore the nearby attractions by using knowledge graph.
f. Now, you want to mark a term.
g. Now, you want to find the term that you have marked.
h. Now, you want to know which kinds of terms you have explored.

The participants were requested to express their thought in the whole process, regardless of their using situation. For example, when the participant would like to click a button, he/she need to say, “I will click the xxx button”. Our team members did not give any help to them. The completion status, time consumed and the number of errors in the using process for each task were recorded. It cost around 30 minutes for this step.

After the test, there was a questionnaire to collect the feedback. The items include:
a. Easiness rating for each task.
b. The overall satisfaction level about convenience.
c. The overall satisfaction level about affordance.
d. The overall satisfaction level about feedback.
e. The overall satisfaction level about appearance.

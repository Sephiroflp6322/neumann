2.Technology Background 

2.1 Knowledge Extraction 

Knowledge extraction is the process of extracting relevant information from structured or unstructured sources. The source data format can be relational database, xml, json, text, image and video etc. After the stage of knowledge extraction, data will be transformed to standardization format such as RDF, OWL and knowledge graph. Knowledge graph is first announced by Google on May 16, 2012. Information from the Google Knowledge Graph is presented as a box, which Google has referred to as the "knowledge panel", to the right of search results.[ref] Knowledge graph involves combining data integration and data visualization technologies to provide users with a unified view of the original data. This technique becomes significantly useful in areas such as business intelligence and education.  

  

2.2 Object Detection 

Object detection is to detect instances of semantic objects of different classes in images or videos. Object detection topics like face detection and pedestrian detection are well researched in recent years. In the case of face detection, images are normalized to gray scale in the first place. Then the possible regions of eyes, nose, mouth are detected by convolution neural network. And the existence of different facial features are measured by the model to output the probability of its class. [ref] Face detection technique attached everybody with a faceID which has already announced by Apple during the unveiling of the iPhone X on September 12, 2017. [ref] 

  

Pedestrian detection is essential in video surveillance systems. It has been actively studied in the last decades because it provides the most fundamental understanding of the video context. Automobile companies like Tesla, BYD are studying related topics actively. Because it's the key technology to develop auto driving system. [ref] 

  

2.3 Positioning System 

A positioning system is a mechanism for determining the location of an object in space. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) allow specialized radio receivers to determine their 3-D space position, as well as time, with an accuracy of 2–20 meters or tens of nanoseconds. Currently deployed systems use microwave signals that can only be received reliably outdoors and that cover most of Earth's surface, as well as near-Earth space. [ref] 

  

Typical positioning systems in the world: 

Global Positioning System - US 

GLONASS – Russia 

Galileo – Europe 

Beidou Navigation System – China 

 

Services provided by positioning systems include personal location positioning, meteorological application, road traffic management, intelligent railway transportation, sea transportation, air transportation, emergency rescue etc. 

  

  

3.Function 

3.1 Combine Disparate Data Silos 

A data silo is a collection of information in an organization that is isolated from and not accessible by other parts of the organization. [ref] Combining data silos across different department can help to save money and reduce storage costs for duplicate information. Knowledge Graphs is a good way to combine disparate silos of data, giving you an overview of all of the knowledge of an organization, a website or a company. 

  

3.2 Bring Together Structured and Unstructured Data 

Structured data is highly organized, while unstructured data has no predefined format. Currently, the existent tools doesn’t work well with the two types of data at the same time. Knowledge graph is an appropriate way to bring them together. The knowledge extraction stage of knowledge graph provides a wrapper to extract, transform and load different data from varies sources. 

  

3.3 Support Business Intelligence, 

Business intelligence (BI) is the technologies used by enterprises for data analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics and data mining. The potential benefits of business intelligence tools include accelerating and improving decision-making, optimizing internal business processes, increasing operational efficiency, driving new revenues and gaining competitive advantage over business rivals. BI systems can also help companies identify market trends and spot business problems that need to be addressed. [ref]
